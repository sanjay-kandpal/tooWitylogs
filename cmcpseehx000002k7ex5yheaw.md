(Crawling through code, babbling in logs, and taking my first steps in tech)

Like any newborn dropped into a chaotic startup world, I started off wide-eyed, slightly confused, and constantly hitting Ctrl+S like it was a pacifier. But three months in, I went from baby steps to (slightly) confident strides.

🍼 Work Reminder – My First Toy
Fetched Excel files from blob storage (because who needs baby food when you’ve got data?).

Performed CRUD operations — yes, I even deleted stuff without crying.

Set visibility rules: end users saw only their toys (tasks), admins saw the whole playground.

Built a scheduler to send out monthly “look-what-you-did” reports.

Handled email notifications with atomic property logic from blob, like a multitasking baby with 8 hands.

Whenever tasks were created/updated — emails went out faster than a toddler spotting cake.

🎈 Oil & Gas Commentary – My Talking Phase
Implemented WebSockets to show live oil and gas prices — real-time babble in tech form.

Used Event Registry API to pull global news and oil-gas updates.

Created short summaries (because toddlers don’t do long stories).

Built a clean display of updates for users to stay informed — no tantrums involved.

🧸 Invoice Automation – My First Robot Friend
Used Selenium to automate repetitive invoice data entry.

The bot didn’t sleep, didn’t cry, and did its job better than most interns.

Handled multi-threading gracefully, like a baby somehow juggling 5 toys without dropping one.

🏗️ React + SharePoint + Power Automate – Building Blocks Time
Created a React flow for transferring pending invoices to “Query” status.

Integrated with SharePoint and Power Automate to make processes smoother than a lullaby.

Helped bridge backend and frontend like stacking blocks until they didn’t fall.

📚 What This Baby Learned:
Write backend code first — and console.log everything like you're asking "What’s that?"

Always ask for UI preferences early — babies don’t like guessing games.

Keep testing until the code stops throwing tantrums.

TL;DR:
In three months, I went from crawling through blob storage to running Selenium bots, and from baby steps in CRUD to full-on toddler tantrums with multithreaded logic. I learned, I built, I broke stuff (then fixed it), and most importantly — I grew.
