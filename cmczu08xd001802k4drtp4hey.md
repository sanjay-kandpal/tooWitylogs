How did I start listening to music? Honestly, no grand story. It just happened. The beginning was simple: I stumbled upon NF. His songs hit differently. I don’t know why, but I’ve always enjoyed sad songs—not because I’m sad, not because I relate, but because there’s a strange kind of joy in them. Melancholy beats and intense lyrics? Chef’s kiss.

Where am I now in my music journey? Wait—before that, I must admit, I tend to jump from one topic to another like I’ve been personally trained by Sadhguru. 🧘‍♂️ Anyway, back to the story...

So yeah—NF. I started listening to most of his stuff around 2017. But the real immersion happened around 2019–2020. Picture this: me, doing DSA (yep, Data Structures & Algorithms, the love language of computer science), earbuds in, grinding leetcode problems, while my ears were literally screaming for mercy. They begged me to stop, but I said, “Shut up, we vibe now.” 😌

That phase was weird—songs that made no sense were somehow making all the sense. I wasn’t even catching 70% of the lyrics, but that didn’t stop me. Later, I moved on to Anne-Marie and others, fantasizing about situations that never existed (as one does). It was like writing fake stories in my head and casting myself as the tragic lead. Oscar-worthy performances, truly.

Then came a turning point—my friend dragged me into the Raftaar vs Emiway beef (yes, the Indian rap scene). I had no clue what was going on, but I nodded like I totally understood. Gotta keep up appearances, you know? Inside, it was all white noise.

But then, I stumbled upon a track—Gumaan. I listened to it over and over again, and suddenly, something clicked. I didn't understand it initially, but something about it stuck. That’s when Talha Anjum entered the picture—and to this day, I still listen to him. Through his music, I started realizing things—like how I’d created fake narratives about people in my life, blaming them for things they never did, just to fill emotional gaps.

So where am I now?

Right now, I’m in a phase where I get the music. I relate to stories—mine and theirs. Their pain, their flex, my healing, my evolution. I’ve outgrown some artists I used to love, and I’ve found new ones who speak to where I am now. Music has helped me grow, cope, and understand life a little more pragmatically.

It's not just listening anymore—it's therapy. It’s reflection. It’s growth
